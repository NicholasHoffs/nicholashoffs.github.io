I"ê<p>‚ÄúPositionless Basketball‚Äù is a misnomer. It‚Äôs no wonder that the standards created over half a century ago no longer apply to today‚Äôs game, and we shouldn‚Äôt expect them to. Bigs can shoot threes, point guards do more than pass, and <a href="https://www.nba.com/player/203999">some seven-footers pass like Magic</a>. It‚Äôs time to change how we define NBA positions ‚Äî Enter K-Means.</p>

<p>K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that groups, or clusters, data together. It does this by randomly selecting some points, assigning other points to them based on distance, and then iteratively optimizing until it finds the best clusters. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4b5d3muPQmA">here</a> for a much more detailed explanation[1]. These groupings can give us insights into relationships we hadn‚Äôt previously known about.</p>

<p>With that, let‚Äôs begin:</p>

<h2 id="part-1-collecting-data">Part 1: Collecting Data</h2>

<p>There are a few ways to get the data we want, but all of them involve reaching endpoints in one way or another. An endpoint is where we access the data directly from a server. Here are the options for accessing data:</p>

<p>One is scraping player data from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">Basketball Reference</a>. This is a good option if you want data from before the 1996‚Äì97 season(how far back the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/">NBA‚Äôs site</a> goes). Today, we don‚Äôt need anything but the 2020‚Äì21 season.</p>

<p>Another option is using <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/">NBA‚Äôs stat</a> page. If you navigate to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sortable player/team stats</code>, that‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find what you need. Clicking through the tabs will give you access to all their data, including some really advanced stuff like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">playtypes</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tracking</code>. These advanced stats are why I prefer using the NBA‚Äôs website, but there‚Äôs also the drawback that sometimes websites will block requests if you make too many. A good fix that I‚Äôve learned is to throw a 3 second sleep into whatever you‚Äôre looping.</p>

<p>Lastly, you can use python libraries other people have created to ‚Äúabstract away‚Äù the need to scrape. I don‚Äôt like using libraries because they can become outdated, and the visual tables on nba.com make it easier to find what I‚Äôm looking for. However, here are some excellent options:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/swar/nba_api"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nba_api</code></a> ‚Äî this is the most extensive API library for nba.com data, and it has documentation on all the endpoints. For info on how to use it, I recommend <a href="https://www.playingnumbers.com/2019/12/how-to-get-nba-data-using-the-nba_api-python-module-beginner/">this article</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/bradleyfay/py-Goldsberry"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">py-goldsberry</code></a> ‚Äî named after the famous statmeister Kirk Goldsberry, this library also uses nba.com but is slightly easier to pick up in terms of syntax than nba_api, in my opinion.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/vishaalagartha/basketball_reference_scraper"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">basketball_reference_scraper</code></a> ‚Äî as the name goes, this API gets the stats from <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">Basketball Reference</a>. Like author <a href="https://github.com/vishaalagartha">‚ÄúVishaala Gartha‚Äù</a> says, using this has the advantage of being able to request large amounts of data without being blocked from requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, we‚Äôll be manually scraping from nba.com since that‚Äôs my method of choice.</p>

<p>First, you have to find the data you want. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Players ‚Äî General ‚Äî Traditional</code> is the page for simple data like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PTS, FG%, 3PA, REB, STL, etc.</code> We want this basic data for our position classifier, but I‚Äôm using the 2020‚Äì21 season. Now, it‚Äôs not as easy copying the link; you have to do a little bit of digging. It might seem confusing at first, but it‚Äôs really not once you get it down.</p>

<p>Open up Developer Tools<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(ctrl-shift-I on Chrome and Windows)</code>, navigate to the network tab, and then refresh the page. You‚Äôll see a bunch of complicated links under the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Name</code> tab, but what we‚Äôre looking for begins with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leaguedashplayerstats</code>(it‚Äôll say this for every stat category). Sorting by name makes it easier to find, but make sure you get the one with type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xhr</code> if you see two. Copy the request URL.</p>

<p>This is what you‚Äôll send the GET request to ‚Äî make sure to install and import the package <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">requests</code> to get the data. We‚Äôre also going to be using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pandas</code>, so import that while you‚Äôre at it. Whenever requesting from nba.com, include these headers that allow the query to go through.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>import requestsheaders  = {

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we make the request and use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.json()</code> to convert the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_requests_response.asp">request response object</a> information into json data [2]:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>json_basic = requests.get(basic_url,headers=headers).json()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you look through the json data, you‚Äôll notice that everything we want(stat categories and the data itself) is under <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[‚ÄúresultSets‚Äù][0]</code>. The features(e.g. PLAYER_NAME, FG%) come by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[‚Äúheaders‚Äù]</code> and the data from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[‚ÄúrowSet‚Äù]</code>. We have to convert the data to a pandas DataFrame so we can manipulate it better.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>features = json_basic['resultSets'][0]['headers']
data = pd.DataFrame(json_basic['resultSets'][0]['rowSet'])data.columns = features
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Notice that I set the columns of data = features, this makes the columns align with their actual name, instead of being ordered by [0,1,2,3,‚Ä¶]</p>

<h5 id="our-data-dataframe-should-look-like-this-now">Our ‚Äúdata‚Äù DataFrame should look like this now:</h5>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/OurDataFrame.png" alt="Our ‚Äúdata‚Äù DataFrame should look like this now" /></p>

<p>While this data can be useful, there‚Äôs a lot of junk. We‚Äôre gonna have to change that but for the time being take a second to think about which category could be useful for categorizing playtypes. Do we want it to discriminate based on wins or losses, or fantasy points, or nickname?</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/Junk.png" alt="‚Ä¶lots and lots of junk" /></p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to leave that until later on to simplify things a little. For now, I think we need more data. Although these basic stats tell us something, it lacks the complexity that will help differentiate some different players from the others. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Rebounding %</code> actually gives us more information about a player‚Äôs rebounding ability than pure boards(Thinking Basketball explains this really well <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJAoM-eF_f8&amp;list=PLtzZl14BrKjTJZdubjNEY5jU0fGOiy51x&amp;index=3">here</a>). To get everything we want, let‚Äôs get some advanced data by using the same scraping technique on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Players ‚Äî General ‚Äî Advanced</code>. Lastly, I want to differentiate between inside scorers and perimeter shooters. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Players ‚Äî Shot Dashboard ‚Äî General</code> gives percentages based on distance. This gives us the following code in total(I wrapped the scraping process into a function because we have to repeat it multiple times):</p>

def get_data(url):
    json = requests.get(url,headers=headers).json()    features = json['resultSets'][0]['headers']
    data = pd.DataFrame(json['resultSets'][0]['rowSet'])    data.columns = features

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see, I keep ‚ÄúPLAYER_NAME‚Äù each time. We want to aggregate this data into one DataFrame, but there has to be some common identifier. Names work well. Here‚Äôs how you combine them:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>data = data.merge(data_adv,on='PLAYER_NAME')
data = data.merge(data_shotdash,on='PLAYER_NAME')
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Data</code> has 81 features, so let‚Äôs cut that down to the bare essentials. Immediately, we can take out everything non-stat-based, like player names, team names, age, or fantasy-related stats. We also want to remove players with less than 20 games played and 10 minutes since any with small sample sizes are ‚Äúdistorted.‚Äù There are also certain stats that we don‚Äôt want. Wins shouldn‚Äôt affect what group a player belongs to, for example. I‚Äôll show what I took out below, but you should consider what will help the model perform better. I‚Äôm also gonna store the names in a DataFrame because we‚Äôll want them later.</p>

<p>This is a quick way of eliminating all the rank-based stats that we don‚Äôt want in our model.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>data.drop(data.filter(regex='RANK').columns, axis=1, inplace=True)data = data[(data['GP'] &gt; 20) &amp; (data['MIN'] &gt; 10)]
names = data['PLAYER_NAME']data.drop(['PLAYER_NAME','W_PCT','PLAYER_ID','PFD','NICKNAME','TEAM_ID','TEAM_ABBREVIATION','AGE','GP','W','L','MIN','NBA_FANTASY_PTS','DD2','TD3','CFID','CFPARAMS', 'PLUS_MINUS','DREB'], axis=1, inplace=True)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The last step of the data part: scaling. You‚Äôll want to import StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing. This standardizes by transforming the mean to 0 and the variance to 1. Standardizing is a necessary step before running PCA.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>data = StandardScaler().fit_transform(data)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With all that out of the way, let‚Äôs get to the good part.</p>

<h2 id="part-2-dimensionality-reduction-with-pca">Part 2: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA</h2>

<p>Principle Component Analysis(PCA) is a method for data visualization and dimensionality reduction that uses eigenvalues and some matrix algebra to calculate orthogonal components. Orthogonal means that these vectors are uncorrelated, so we‚Äôre getting the most info from the least components. These components will be ordered by explained variance, so the first component will ‚Äúhold the most info.‚Äù If that didn‚Äôt make sense, just know that PCA is a way of squeezing our data down into a compressed form.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/PCAExplanation.png" alt="The compressed form" /></p>

<p>Dimensionality reduction helps in a few ways. For one, it cuts down on the cost of computation. Considering that we don‚Äôt lose much information when reducing all those features into 16 components, it‚Äôs a no-brainer. It also helps with visualization(as you‚Äôll see in a second). Lastly, it avoids the problems with high-dimensional data like overfitting and other issues with the clustering algorithms. But don‚Äôt stress about that now, just know it‚Äôs a good practice.</p>

<p>First, we want to figure out how many dimensions to actually reduce. There‚Äôs a tradeoff between achieving lower dimension data and keeping the information. Explained variance is a good way of measuring how much information we kept from the original to our PCA dataset. If you‚Äôve ever taken a stats course, it‚Äôs really similar to R¬≤.</p>

<p>To get a good idea of the right number of principles components(which is like the number of features), lets run PCA at each component number and then calculate the explained variance for each of these.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
variances = []
for n_components in range(2,25):
    pca = PCA(n_components = n_components)
    components = pca.fit_transform(data)
    print('Components: {} Variance: {}'.format(n_components,         sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)))
    variances.append(sum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_))
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here we run fit_transform with our PCA model on each n_components from 2 to 25. Then, we sum the explained_variance_ratio_ to get the number we want since that‚Äôs the explained variance for each individual component.</p>

<h5 id="this-is-what-i-got">This is what I got:</h5>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/Variances.png" alt="Variances" /></p>

<h5 id="and-the-graph">And the graph‚Ä¶</h5>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/VariancesGraph.png" alt="Variances Graph" /></p>

<p>It approaches a horizontal asymptote, so we really lose the bang for our buck at a certain point. I‚Äôll be going with 16 components.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pca = PCA(n_components=16)
components = pca.fit_transform(data)
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="part-3-running-k-means">Part 3: Running K-Means</h2>

<p>We‚Äôve got some nice looking, low dimensional, cleaned-up data that‚Äôs begging to be clustered. Thankfully, the process is somewhat similar to PCA in terms of syntax. We‚Äôre gonna create some metrics to judge the clustering(keeping in mind what we want to analyze).</p>

<p>Silhouette is a metric for evaluating the performance of clustering. It uses both intra-cluster distances(between points in a cluster) and inter-cluster distances(between clusters). 1 means a perfect cluster, while anything closer to 0 shows more and more overlap. -1 means you‚Äôve got some error with samples in the cluster, but that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. Inertia is another measurement that uses the distance from points to its centroid.</p>

<p>Using these two measurements, we should get a good idea of how many clusters to use.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.metrics import silhouette_scoresilhouettes = []
sse = []
for n_clusters in range(2,20):
    
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters,random_state=84)
    
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(components)
    
    silhouette = silhouette_score(components, cluster_labels)
    silhouettes.append(silhouette)
    sse.append(kmeans.inertia_)    print("n_clusters = {}, silhouette score: {} - sum of squared  distance: {}".format(n_clusters, silhouette, kmeans.inertia_))
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="outcome">Outcome:</h4>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/Silhouettes.png" alt="Silhouettes" /></p>

<h4 id="graphs">Graphs:</h4>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/SilhouettesGraph.png" alt="Silhouettes Graph" />
<img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/InertiaGraph.png" alt="Inertia Graph" /></p>

<p>Don‚Äôt get too excited about these numbers. We obviously don‚Äôt want one or two clusters, so the high scores doesn‚Äôt mean anything to us. We also don‚Äôt want too many clusters since the effectiveness of the clusters seem to drop off quite a bit. 11 looks like a sweet spot.</p>

<p>We‚Äôre on the home stretch now. Since we know that 11 is a good number, all we have to do is run K-Means again.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=11,random_state=42)kmeans.fit(components)
km = kmeans.predict(components)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/ClusterCounts.png" alt="Distribution of Clusters" /></p>

<p>This is the distribution of clusters. We‚Äôve got lots of twos and fives. It‚Äôs time to examine the clusters a long the data to see what it means. This is the really fun part.</p>
<h1 id="part-4-cluster-analysis">Part 4: Cluster Analysis</h1>

<p>I want to organize this into a neat DataFrame and put the cluster groups alongisde players. It‚Äôll make everything a lot easier to see.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>final = pd.DataFrame()
final['PLAYER_NAME'] = names
final['Cluster'] = km
</code></pre></div></div>

<h5 id="it-should-look-something-like-this">It should look something like this:</h5>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/AllCluster.png" alt="Clusters" /></p>

<p>A cool way of visualizing the clustering algorithm is to graph the clusters along the first two PCA components ‚Äî like so:</p>

<p>#Getting unique labels</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>label = km
u_labels = np.unique(label)
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_#plotting the results:
for i in u_labels:

plt.scatter(centroids[:,0] , centroids[:,1] , s = 40, color = 'k')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/PCAEDA.png" alt="Thanks to askpython.com" /></p>

<p>Hmm, doesn‚Äôt look great‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Although we could make changes to achieve more separate clustering, this graph sheds some light on the positionless basketball theory.</p>

<p>Playstyles are more fluid than they ever have been, so lots of players exist on the continuum somewhere in between. Clusters 3, 8, and 4 really stand out.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs clear that this cluster is selecting for star bigs. Unlike star guards, who they share the most in common with, these players should have higher rebounding percentage, lower assist numbers, and better efficiency(besides free throws).</p>

<p>Side-note: Isn‚Äôt it weird that Jokic is here? I thought he‚Äôd be more ‚Äúguard-y‚Äù.</p>

<p>Hm, they‚Äôre not that much more efficient and rebounding isn‚Äôt that impressive. Also, what‚Äôs up with those passing numbers? Even their assist percentage to usage rate is high(you‚Äôll figure out what this means later on), which says that star bigs really are decent at playmaking.</p>

<p>The defensive rating shows why these guys are still getting paid. Like the cluster 10 guards, they have a really good defensive rating that makes them almost positive in net rating.</p>

<p>In particular, low volume, effective playmakers. This means that, while they don‚Äôt control the ball on that many possessions, they can create a lot of offense. Usage Rate(the percent of plays that a player uses) is a decent representation of volume. Assist percentage(the percent of field goals a player assists when they‚Äôre on the floor) is a good metric for playmaker effectiveness.</p>

<p>Dividing assist percentage by usage rate will give us a good idea of whether or not our suspision is right:</p>

<p>I wouldn‚Äôt be too suprised by the high assist percentage. We‚Äôre comparing with the rest of the league, so no wonder high usage-rate guards are gonna be assisting a lot.</p>

<p>It‚Äôs interesting that K-Means was able to pick up on differences between three point shooting guards and forwards, since the statistical differences are minor.</p>

<p>This tells us that the guard category is much more specialized in what they do than forwards. Forwards score four more points on average and take significantly more shots, but guards shoot more threes in total. They‚Äôre also less active playmakers and hold the ball less.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/Cluster10.png" alt="Cluster 10" /></p>

<p>Even though we select players with over 10 minutes per game, we still get a lot of players who have very low volume and efficiency. This seems strange since most teams don‚Äôt want this type of player on their team, but I think this inadvertently selects for skilled defenders. The players who don‚Äôt have great offensive stats and still get minutes must be solid defenders, or otherwise, they wouldn‚Äôt be on the floor that much. Interestingly, their -2.94 Offensive Rating is nearly compensated by their high defensive rating.</p>

<h2 id="observations">Observations:</h2>

<p>If we attach the net rating of a player‚Äôs team to their cluster and then take the average net rating for each cluster, it might give an idea of how rosters are constructed and what players help them perform well.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/DisprovingTheMyth/NR.png" alt="Net Ratings" /></p>

<p>As you can see, offensive liabilities(cluster 1) tend to be on bad teams. Teams that play 1-ers for more than ten minutes a night are probably either tanking or simply lack a good roster. On the other hand, three-point shooters usually seem to be on very good teams. The teams that rely on three-point shooters, like Utah, are generally very efficient and have high offensive ratings. Keep in mind that net rating is subject to some biases in the way it‚Äôs calculated.</p>

<h2 id="general-conclusions">General Conclusions:</h2>

<p>Admittedly, I wouldn‚Äôt call some of these clusters positions. Positions are supposed to be based on playstyle, not volume or efficiency. The players with high usage rates don‚Äôt seem to perform as well with clustering since they excel in every stat and therefore are ‚Äúinflated,‚Äù but this could likely be compensated for using adjusted stats(like per possession).</p>

<h2 id="future-ideas">Future Ideas:</h2>

<p>You can do a lot using this basic method of clustering data. Applying K-Means to team stats instead could tell you which team playstyles tend to perform well. If you use the same clusters but predict earlier seasons, you could see how certain platypes have grown or decreased in popularity over time(like 3 point shooters). Maybe you find the perfect roster by tracking how a team‚Äôs success correlates to the distribution of their clusters ‚Äî this could come in handy for fantasy. The moral of the story is that you should try experimenting with this on some new data and see what you get.</p>
